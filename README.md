## Tips

1. Avoid passing too many attributes or arguments. Limit yourself to five props that you pass into your component.
2. Use ReactJS defaultProps and ReactJS propTypes.
3. Use linter, break up lines that are too long.
4. Keep your own jslint configuration file.
5. Always use a dependency manager with a lock file, such as NPM or yarn.
6. Every time you find a bug, make sure you write a test first.
7. Use ES6 de-structuring for your props.
8. Use conditional rendering.
9. User `map()` to collect and render collections of components.
10. Use partial components, such as `<>` â€¦ `</>`
11. Name your event handlers with handle prefixes, such as `handleClick()` or `handleUpdate()`.
12. Use `onChange` to control your inputs, such as `onChange={this.handleInputChange()}`.
